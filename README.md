# MyModelDeployement1

Created a linear regression model using LinearRegression provided in the sklearn.model_selection in the sklearn in Pyhton.
I mapped sea view and used this mapped data and size data to predict the house rent.
and I got 80% accuracy in predicting the price based on size and sea view.
